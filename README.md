# Game-of-Life-Clone
This is a quickly made clone of Conway's Game of Life made for programming practice.

You play the game by clicking in squares on the grid to place or remove tiles.
When you the click the "pause/un-pause" button, the game will begin.
You can pause the game at any point to place more tiles or even do it while the game is running.
